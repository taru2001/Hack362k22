## Introduction:
<b>Rashan Adda</b> <br>
Problem : Inspite of employing large chunk of country's population , the local vendors face problems of eviction , irregular and insecure income , their products are not completely sold and are wasted and because its not legal they are prone to harrassment by various law enforcement agencies.  <br>
Solution : Revolutionising consumption and selling of local products by changing the way customers and local vendors interact , we are desiging a platform where we would be warehousing products of these vendors and sell them as a whole and revenue would be distributed according to the supply they provide.As we will be having dynamic prices according to demands and reviews , it will boost sales of all products and will assure decent bussiness of all vendors.
